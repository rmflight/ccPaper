<h1>ReAnalysis based on reviewer comments</h1>

<p>Because we have re-worked the publication as a paper about the tool, we have decided to do a re-analysis of the original data presented in the original manuscript based on the reviewer comments, as well as include other data sets. </p>

<h1>Muscle VS Skin Denervation</h1>

<p>The original data consisted of muscle denervation data from GSE4411, and skin denervation data from Dr. Jeffrey Petruska.</p>

<h1>UC VS Crohn&#39;s</h1>

<p>From GEO there is a ulcerative colitis vs crohn&#39;s disease data set available, GSE36807. This would be a nice one to try, as there is already a publication on it.</p>

<h1>Metabolomics VS Transcriptomics</h1>

<p>The NCI 60 database has both metabolomics and transcriptomics data available. Unfortunately, there is no <strong>control</strong> data set.</p>

<p>Metabolomics File: </p>

<ul>
<li>File Format: SAMPLENAME, TITLE, PANELNBR, CELLNBR, pname, cellname, VALUE</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideas for analysis: slow vs fast growing, sensitive to compound vs insensitive to compound</p>

<p>Transcriptomics File:</p>

<ul>
<li>File Format: MOLTID (NCI pattern #), ACC, Gene, TITLE, MOLTNBR (NCI exp. id #), PANELNBR, CELLNBR, pname, cellname, CHIP, FEATURE_ID, UniGene, GeneID, VALUE Gene assignments are based on Unigene Build #U225 (August 2010)</li>
</ul>
